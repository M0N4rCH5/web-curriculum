# Day Two

Today we went over:

1.Command Line
2. Visual Studio Code

Command Line
The command line is a text interface for your computer. Itâ€™s a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computerâ€™s operating system to run.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.

Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

### Homework
1. Now that you've seen a little bit of Command line, use it. Make a projects folder at root, move your profile there (use `mv`).
2. Set up Visual Studio Code to your liking. Explore themes, Keymaps ( Atom , Sublime and VIM ðŸ¤® are all supported) and work plugins.
